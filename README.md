Country Guide (Frontend Demo)

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that fetches country information using the REST Countries API.

📌 Note:

 This code is part of my NGINX Project Challenge demo, where I serve a static site using NGINX.

 If you are interested in just the frontend code and API usage, you can find it here!

How It Works

Fetches and displays:

Country name

National flag

Capital

Region

Quick Start

Clone the repo

Open index.html in your browser

or

Serve it through an NGINX container if following along with the NGINX Project Challenge.
