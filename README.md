Country Guide (Frontend Demo)

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that fetches country information using the REST Countries API.

 This code is part of my NGINX Project Challenge demo, where I serve a static site using NGINX.

 If you are interested in just the frontend code and API usage, you can find it here!
